          <p>The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. <br>
            You play on a three by three game board. The first player is known as X and the second is O. <br>
            Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either oppent has three in a row <br>
            or all nine squares are filled. X always goes first, and in the event that no one has three in a row, <br>
            the stalemate is called a cat game.</p>
